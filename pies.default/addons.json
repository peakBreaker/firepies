You also need to specify which source file URLs to monitor. After creating a reload rule, when you visit a page that matches the host URL, it will automatically start monitoring the specified source files if they're included in the host page. When a change is detected, it will reload the page or only the source file if supported (frames and stylesheets) and enabled. Supported source files are stylesheet includes, script includes and frame sources and the page itself. Both the host URL and source file URLs support wildcard patterns using the * character.\n\nDoesn't work? Need a feature?  — Please create an issue on Github or send a mail to blaisekal@gmail.com. Please specify steps to reproduce so I can fix your issue.\n\nDue to security restrictions in web extensions, files served using the file system (file://...) cannot be monitored. A quick and easy workaround is to serve local files over http using Python, NodeJS or PHP.","weeklyDownloads":206,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Blaise Kal","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/1927954/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/194/194364.png?modified=1543520991","width":386,"height":214,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/194/194364.png?modified=1543520991","thumbnailWidth":386,"thumbnailHeight":214,"caption":"The toolbar menu shows an enable/disable option, your reload rules and an option to create a new rule."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/194/194363.png?modified=1543520991","width":350,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/194/194363.png?modified=1543520991","thumbnailWidth":320,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"This is the form to create or update a reload rule."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/194/194362.png?modified=1543520992","width":377,"height":198,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/194/194362.png?modified=1543520992","thumbnailWidth":377,"thumbnailHeight":198,"caption":"A badge shows the number of files being monitored in the active tab.
